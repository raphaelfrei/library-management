# Library Management System in C
Software created to understand (and remember) more about programming in C and SQLite database connection.
The program was created using MacOS as operating system - So some commands may not work perfectly on Windows.

## Why?
This software was not developed with the intention on being used - Created to remember somethings about programming with C language.
